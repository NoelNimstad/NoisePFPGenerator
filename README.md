## How To

clone the repository or download the code as a zip

open the index.html file in any browser, refresh the page until you get a result you like

## Config

inside the script.js file you will find your configuration, which is as follows:
- FIFTYFIFTY, split the colors on the left and right, like my own profile picture
- C1, first color, always used
- C2, second color, always used
- C3, third color, appears in FIFTYFIFTY mode
- C4, fourth color, appears in FIFTYFIFTY mode
- W, width, how many pixels wide the image is
- H, height, how many pixels tall the image is
- SCALE, the image scale, scales all pixels to SCALE : 1 so that the image doesn't end up blurry on websites that use blurring filters
